# Welcome to my How-To Repository  
I often find myself working on personal projects and spending a lot of time doing the research, completing the project but not really organising the resources after I've got what I want done.  

This repository was created so that I can record useful information in a hopefully well organised fashion so it's easy for both other readers and me to follow should one of my projects need to replicated or repeated.  

There will be a few empty directories as I begin setting this up - so if there's nothing there, it's because I haven't written it yet! 😆

Wish me luck!
